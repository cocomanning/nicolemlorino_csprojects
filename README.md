This repository stores files of various programs I have coded.

## Townle (townle.py)
This python program is the code behind my guessing game "Townle," inspired by Wordle, Globle, 
and Worldle. Essentially, the player tries to guess the mystery city, with each guess 
getting a measure of accuracy provided by the system. The player plays "hot or cold" 
until they have found the mystery city. 

Townle is still being workshopped and only exists as a python terminal game at this 
point. I am working on developing a website to host the game, complete with an 
interactive map that updates with each guess and gives the player visual clues 
regarding their accuracy. Eventually, the mystery city will change every day instead 
of every round. My goal is to create an assortment of mini games, with each game 
consisting of cities from different places in the world like Europe, individual U.S. 
states, and individual countries.

## Worst Company Simulation (employees.py)
This python program simulates a model of the worst company, in which an employee's 
mood and well-being varies with the simulated work environment and coworker 
relationships.

## Evil Wordle (evil_wordle.py)
This python program creates an "Evil Wordle" game in which the mystery word changes every 
guess, but the correctly guessed letters and placement are passed onto the new 
word until there is only one viable word remaining.
